== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Tinycart good for web developers? =

Absolutely. With Tinycart, you don't need to worry about designing around a storefront or conforming to specific standards for your website.

You're free to design your client's website or blog in any way you see fit.

This plugin provides an easy way for your clients to insert a buy link into a page or a post, but you can also programatically insert links in the same simple format.

IOW, Tinycart is the first ecommerce app that puts you 100% in complete control of your website design, while also providing a full checkout experience that requires no work by you.

= Do I need an SSL certificate? =

Absolutely not, because Tinycart performs its operations inside an iframe that loads via TLS.

However, TLS is a good idea for all websites, for many reasons - and it's free with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/).

= Is Tinycart similar to WooCommerce? =

Tinycart enables ecommerce, but it does so by letting you quickly insert product buy links into any post or page on your website.

Your items and orders are stored securely at Tinycart.com, rather than in your Wordpress database. This means when you decide to switch to a different CMS or blog platform, or even develop your own website, you can take Tinycart with you.

WooCommerce provides a full storefront, but is very much locked into Wordpress.

= Do my customers have to leave my website to checkout? =

Your customers remain on your website throughout their secure checkout.

= How much does a Tinycart account cost? =

You can find pricing info over at the [Tinycart.com/signup](https://tinycart.com/signup/).

= Which payment gateways does Tinycart support? =

Tinycart currently supports Stripe, a payment provider with many benefits.

Stripe also pays out quickly, meaning you don't need to stress about the infamous "Freezes" that PayPal is known for, etc.

If you have an idea for another payment provider you'd like supported, we'd love to hear it at support[at]tinycart[dot]com.

= Is Tinycart compatible with my custom theme or plugin? =

Tinycart should work fine with any theme or plugin, but if it doesn't, please let us know at support[at]tinycart[dot]com.

= How do I get a Tinycart account? =

Visit [Tinycart](https://tinycart.com/) and click the "signup" link.
